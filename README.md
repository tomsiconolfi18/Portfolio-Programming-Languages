# Portfolio-Programming-Languages


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was made to help students become understand how investments work by prompting them to input the money that they are investing and seeing how it will grow based on the output of the program. This is also based on factors like, the initial investment amount, Monthly deposits,annual interest, and the number of years the investment will go on for. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I was able to promt my code in an organized and easily readable fasion. I did this by making sure there was plenty of reasonable spacing within my promtps.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I feel that I can enhance my code by possibly creating presets based on popular types of investments where the amount of interest is already included in the prompt. This will make my code more efficient for people who are looking for certain investments like realestate for example. 


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

One piece of the code that I founnd challenging was the arithmetic. I overcame this by spacing out every step of math that I needed to do in order to complete this program correctly and in the right order. Going back to zybooks to resfresh  my memory on the math within the code was very helpful.


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

A skill that I have taken from this project that will be transferable are the organization skills within the code. 


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program readable by making sure everything was spaced out and organized correcty. I always kept in mind to keep everything as simple as possible while creating this program. This code is adaptable since the code is so straight forward there are not many limitations to how to program works when it comes to understanding how your investments will grow.
